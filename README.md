A tmux plugin to parse terminal output for filenames and open them in neovim. It works by creating a tmux binding to copy the currently selected panes content, match output that is a file path ending in an extension or with location information 83:57, pass the file paths to fzf, and open the fzf selected files in your default $EDITOR (only tested with neovim currently). The plugin will search for panes in the current window running neovim and open the selected files as new tabs. If a current neovim instances does not exist, a new horizontal pane will be created to host neovim and the files will be opened there.

tmux-fzf-open-files-nvim works on large histories as well:

## Installation 

### TPM

Using TPM, add the following lines to your ~/.tmux.conf:

```bash
set -g @plugin 'Peter-McKinney/tmux-open-file-nvim'
```

Use `prefix + I` to install the plugin which should also source your ~/.tmux.conf but just in case: `prefix + :source ~/.tmux.conf`

Make sure to have your editor environment variable set to neovim:

```bash
export EDITOR='nvim'
```

Please make sure that fzf is installed by following the directions over at: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

## Usage

### Keybindings: 

| Variable Name                   | Description                                                           | Default Binding |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| @open-file-nvim-key             | Parses the current visible pane output for filenames                  | prefix + F      |
| @open-file-nvim-all-key         | Parses the entire available history in the current pane for filenames | prefix + H      |
| @open-file-nvim-all-history-key | Parses the entire history from all panes in a window                  | prefix + G      |

### Capture the output visible in the current pane: 

The default binding uses `F` so `prefix + F` will run the process to find files in the current pane output. A new horizontal pane will be opened to the right of the current pane. The pane visible text will be sent to `fzf -m` multi select mode so that multiple files may be selected and sent to the $EDITOR.

### Capture the entire history of the current pane:

The default binding uses `H` so `prefix + H` will run the above process for the entire history of the current pane.

### Capture the entire history of all panes in a window:

The default binding uses `G` so `prefix + G` will run the above process for the entire history of all panes in a tmux window. This operation can be expensive.

### Change the default bindings

```bash
set -g @open-file-nvim-key {newbinding}
set -g @open-file-nvim-all-key {newbinding}
set -g @open-file-nvim-all-history-key {newbinding}
```

### Enable cross-window neovim search

By default, the plugin only searches for neovim instances in the current tmux window. To enable searching across all windows in the current session and automatically switch to the window containing neovim:

```bash
set -g @tmux-open-file-nvim-search-all-windows on
```

## Development

### Link plugin source locally for testing

In the dev folder, there are scripts to automate linking the plugin locally for development / testing and for resetting the local link to the github link. The scripts edit the `~/.tmux.conf` and use the tpm clean and install scripts found in `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin` to remove and install plugins. `dev/link-plugin-locally.sh` creates a symbolic link to `~/github/tmux-fzf-open-files-nvim`. Change this to where your cloned repository resides.  You can then run `dev/link-plugin-locally.sh` to restore the github plugin source.

### Setting up unit tests and running using bats

We use the bats unit test framework to write and execute bash unit tests https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core. Refer to https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html for the full installation instructions. Here are common ones: 

MacOS using homebrew: 
```bash
brew install bats-core
```

Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install bats
```

To run the unit tests:
```bash
bats tests
```

### Github Actions

#### Shellcheck

We use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to perform static analysis as a PR check. To install shellcheck locally refer to the installation guide in the shellcheck github. You can also use https://www.shellcheck.net/

To run shellcheck on all files in the project locally run `dev/run-shellcheck.sh`.

Warnings will not cause the github action check to fail, only errors.

#### Shfmt

We use [shfmt](https://github.com/patrickvane/shfmt) to ensure consistent formatting. You can run formatting on the project by running `dev/run-format.sh`

We also run the bats tests as a part of the PR check workflow, which is covered under the unit testing section. But since you're here: `bats tests` will execute the unit tests for the project.
